# This web application serves to provide a service for the non-profit organization, sandipani, to help them manage members and other critical information about their organization. The app not only allows them to add and edit members to keep track of all patreons, but also allows them to record donation infromation to keep track of donations, and other funds such as sales and sponsorships. The app is designed to also keep track of different events run by the organization. They can also record event names and dates to keep track of their records within the app as well. The app is run by organizers who have different roles allowing them to do different things. Certain roles can only manage members, while some can view money related info. Organizers can sign up through the app, and are approved for use of the app by an admin (the highest privilaged role) who assigns them a role and either accepts or denies them. Once an organizer is approved, they are free to access the app! We hope Sandipani can benefit with the use of this app and we can help enable them to benefit the community even more!
